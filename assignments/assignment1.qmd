## assignment 1

This assignment comes right after the first session, where we discussed resampling.

## Task

Go to the [IMS website](https://ims.gov.il/en/data_gov){target="_blank"}, and choose another weather station we have not worked with yet. Download 10-minute data for a full year, any year.

Make 3 graphs:

1. Monthly temperature averages
1. Daily maximum temperature
1. For each day of the year, show the number of hours when global solar radiation was above, on average, the threshold 10 W/m$^2$. Now add another line, for the threshold 500 W/m$^2$.

**Make 7 more graphs** (total of 10 graphs) of whatever you find interesting. Explore the dataset you downloaded. Use the tools we learned during class. Be creative.

You must download this <a href="/assignments/assignment1-template.ipynb" download>Jupyter Notebook template</a>. Create a zip file with your Jupyter notebook and with the csv you used. Upload this csv to the moodle task we created.

## Evaluation

All your assignments will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

- 40% Presentation. How the graphs look, labels, general organization, markdown, clean code.
- 30% Discussion. This is where you explain what you did, what you found out, etc.
- 15% Depth of analysis. You can analyze/explore the data with different levels of complexity, this is where we take that into consideration.
- 10% Replicability: Your code runs flawlessly.
- 5%: Code commenting. Explain in your code what you are doing, this is good for everyone, especially for yourself!
- Bonus: 10% for originality, creative problem solving, or notable analysis.
