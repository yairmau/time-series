## motivation

I used multiple sources for this lesson. The most noteworthy are these.

[Jez Swanson's "An Interactive Introduction to Fourier Transforms"](https://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/index.html).  
Truly amazing website. Start here.

[Liz O'Gorman's "Decomposing Fourier transforms â€” an introduction to time-frequency decomposition"](https://dibsmethodsmeetings.github.io/fourier-transforms/)  
This is excellent. A balanced combination of theory and coding for the beginner.
