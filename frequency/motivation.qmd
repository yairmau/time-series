## motivation

I used multiple sources for this lesson. The most noteworthy are:

* [Liz O'Gorman's "Decomposing Fourier transforms â€” an introduction to time-frequency decomposition"](https://dibsmethodsmeetings.github.io/fourier-transforms/)
* [Jez Swanson's "An Interactive Introduction to Fourier Transforms"](https://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/index.html)
