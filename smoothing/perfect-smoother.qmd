Noisy series $y$ of length $m$.

The smoothed series is called $z$.

We have conflicting interests:

* we want a $z$ series "as smooth as possible".
* however, the smoother $z$ is, the farthest from $y$ it will be (low fidelity).

Roughness:

$$
R = \displaystyle\sum_i (z_i - z_{i-1})^2
$$


Fit to data:

$$
S = \displaystyle\sum_i (y_i - z_i)^2
$$

Cost functional to be minimized:

$$
Q = S + \lambda R
$$
