# autoregressive processes

This lecture is partially based on @shumway2017time.

Consider the process

$$
x_{t} = \phi\,x_{t-1}
$$

These solutions look suspiciously similar to those obtained with the simplest 1st-order-homogenous differential equation:

$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = \varphi\, x
$$
whose solution is 

$$
x(t) = x_0 e^{\varphi\, t}
$$

Using separation of variables:

$$
\frac{dx}{x} = \varphi\, dt
$$

We now integrate

$$
\int \frac{1}{x}\, dy = \int \varphi\, dt
$$

...yielding

$$
\ln(x) = \varphi\, t + C
$$

where $C$ is an integration constant. Exponentiating both sides:

$$
x(t) = e^{\varphi\, t}\cdot e^C = C e^{\varphi\, t}
$$

If we call the initial condition $x(0)=x_0$, we find that $C=x_0$, and we finally arrive at the solution.

For the exponential solution, it is clear that $x(t)$ grows to infinity if $\varphi>0$, and it goes to zero if $\varphi<0$. This connection is not casual, they are the discrete and continuous versions of the same process. Starting from the continuous process
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = \varphi\, x
$$
and using an approximation of the derivative as
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} \simeq \frac{x(t+\Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t}
$$
we have that
$$
\frac{x(t+\Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t} =  \varphi\, x(t).
$$
Solving for $x(t+\Delta t)$ yields

$$
x(t+\Delta t) = (1 + \Delta t\,\varphi)x(t).
$$

Calling $\phi=1 + \Delta t\,\varphi$ and modifying the notation a little bit gives

$$
x_{t+1} = \phi\,x_{t}.
$$


## AR(1)

Let's add some white noise to this process.

$$
x_{t} = \phi\,x_{t-1} + \varepsilon
$$

This is called an Autoregressive Process of order 1, or AR(1). Here, the current value $x_{t}$ is dependent on the immediately preceding value $x_{t-1}$.

What can we call the special cases when

* $\phi=1.0$
* $\phi=0.0$

## AR(2)

We can define a process that the current state is dependent on the two previous states, each with a different weight.

$$
x_{t} = \phi_1\,x_{t-1} + \phi_2\,x_{t-2} + \varepsilon
$$
