## motivation

See the temperatures for Jerusalem in a 4-day interval:

## questions

* If I know the temperature right now, what does that tell me about the temperature 10 minutes from now? How about 100 minutes? 1000 minutes?

* The same applies to the past: how heavily does past information inform today's measurements?

* **information degradation**: how fast does information from a signal degrade, and gets swamped by noise?

## goals

* discuss what is noise, signal, trend, cycles, etc.
* learn a useful framework to make sense of all the above.
* acquire statistical and time-series tools to analyze my data
* eventually, all the above will be crucial to forcast future states.

Let's go! ðŸš€
