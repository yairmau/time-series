# stationarity

## weak stationarity

A time series is called weakly stationary if the following conditions are met:

1. its mean $\mu$ does not vary in time:
   $$
   \mu_X(t) = \mu_X(t+\tau)
   $$
   for all values of $t$ and $\tau$.
1. its variance is finite for any time $t$:
   $$
   \sigma^2_X(t) < \infty.
   $$
1. The autocorrelation function between two lagged versions of the same time series, $X(t_1)$ and $X(t_2)$, depends only on the difference $\tau=t_2-t_1$.

## strict/strong stationarity

As the name suggests, strict stationarity requires much more than the above. It requires that the joint CDF of two lagged versions of $X$ is the same. It is rare to require such strong terms, we will assume weak stationarity always from now on.

## stationarity of AR(p)

Let's write once more the definition of AR(p):

$$
x_{t} = \phi_1\,x_{t-1} + \phi_2\,x_{t-2} + \cdots + \phi_p\,x_{t-p} + \varepsilon
$$

We can define the **backward shift operator** $B$ as

$$
B X_t = X_{t-1}
$$

Of course, if $B$ is applied $p$ times, it shifts $X$ thus:

$$
B^p X_t = X_{t-p}.
$$

With that in hand, we can rewrite the definition of AR(p) as follows:

$$
x_{t} = \phi_1\, B\,x_t + \phi_2\,B^2\,x_t + \cdots + \phi_p\,B^p\,x_t + \varepsilon
$$

We have many terms with $x_{t}$, so let's group them on the left-hand side:

$$
x_{t}\, \phi(B) = \varepsilon,
$$

where the **characteristic polynomial** $\phi(B)$ is

$$
\phi(B) = 1 - \phi_1\, B - \phi_2\,B^2 - \cdots - \phi_p\,B^p
$$

In order to determine the stationarity of AR(p), we need to find the roots of

$$
\phi(B) = 0,
$$

called characteristic roots. These roots are often complex numbers.

AR(p) is stationary if ALL the characteristic roots lie OUTSIDE the unit circle.

The reason for this is not obvious. A nice explanation can be found in this [StackExchange response](https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/65776).

## stationarity of AR(1)

We need to solve the roots of the characteristic equation

$$
1 - \phi_1\, B = 0.
$$

The only root is

$$
B = \frac{1}{\phi_1}
$$

Because we require that this root is greater than 1, we have that:

$$
\frac{1}{\phi_1} > 1\quad \longrightarrow \quad \phi < 1.
$$

This result corroborates our conclusion from before:

## stationarity of AR(2)

We need to solve the roots of the characteristic equation

$$
1 - \phi_1 B - \phi_2 B^2 = 0.
$$

For the AR(2) time series from before, here are the roots of the characteristic polynomial plotten on the complex plane:

Because complex roots come in pairs, I plotted above only one of the roots, the one with positive imaginary component. The second panel $(\phi_1=1.16,\phi_2=-0.33)$ has two real roots, so both are plotted in blue.

The AR(2) time series will have a periodic component if the roots are complex, and the frequency of oscillation is

$$
f_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi}\cos^{-1}\left( \frac{\phi_1}{2\sqrt{(-\phi_2)}} \right)
$$
