### course aims

This course aims at giving the students a broad overview of the main steps involved in the analysis of time series: data management, data wrangling, visualization, analysis, and forecast. The course will provide a hands-on approach, where students will actively engage with real-life datasets from the field of environmental science.

### learning outcomes

On successful completion of this module,students should be able to:

* Explore a time-series dataset, while formulating interesting questions.
* Choose the appropriate tools to attack the problem and answer the questions.
* Communicate their findings and the methods they used to achieve them, using graphs, statistics, text, and a well-documented code.
