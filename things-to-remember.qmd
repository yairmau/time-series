# stuff {.unnumbered}

Hey! What are you doing here? This page is not meant for you ðŸ˜œ

* This is not a coding course. Neither a programming course. Our goal is to learn how to **think** about time series. Of course, we want to tell the computer how to do stuff, and that requires programming.
* "How do you do?" *How do you do what?!*  
  *Welche Sprachen sprechen Sie?*  
  First do, then get use to it.  
  Once you got used to doing, go back and understand better.
