# motivation

This is a bit grim for *motivation*, but it is super important.

Let's discuss what's going on by looking at [these interactive graphs](https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/sst_daily/).

From @westen2024physics:

> Classical early warning indicators, such as the increase in the variance and/or the (lag-1) autocorrelation, when applied to sea surface temperature-based time series, suggest that the present-day Atlantic meridional overturning circulation approaches a tipping point before the end of this century (11, 12). 

## questions

* disconsidering the expected annual cycle, how fast is the ocean warming up?
* what is a *typical* annual oscillation in temperature?
* how can I model processes such as this, where there are both a clear trend and a seasonal component?
