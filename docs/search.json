The course will provide a hands-on approach, where students will actively engage with real-life datasets from the field of environmental science.\n\n\nlearning outcomes\nOn successful completion of this module,students should be able to:\n\nExplore a time-series dataset, while formulating interesting questions.\nChoose the appropriate tools to attack the problem and answer the questions.\nCommunicate their findings and the methods they used to achieve them, using graphs, statistics, text, and a well-documented code.\n\n\n\ncourse content\n\nData wrangling: organization, cleaning, merging, filling gaps, excluding outliers, smoothing, resampling.\nVisualization: best practices for graph making using leading python libraries.\nAnalysis: stationarity, seasonality, (auto)correlations, lags, derivatives, spectral analysis.\nForecast: ARIMA\nData management: how to plan ahead and best organize large quantities of data. If there is enough time, we will build a simple time-series database.\n\n\n\nbooks and other sources\nClick here.\n\n\ncourse evaluation\nThere will be assignments during the semester (totaling 50% of the final grade), and one final project (50%).\n\n\nEvaluation policy\n\nIndividual Work: While we support helping your peers, it’s important to remember that all assignments must be completed individually. This means that your submissions should be your own unique work and not contain code or text that is identical to someone else’s.\nZero Plagiarism: Do not copy text verbatim from any source. Always express ideas in your own words.\nOn-Time Submission: Assignments must be turned in by the specified deadline. Late submissions will receive a grade of 0. If you require an extension, requests will only be considered if made at least 24 hours before the due date.\nNon-Compliance Consequence: Assignments that do not adhere to these guidelines will automatically receive a grade of 0.",

The weights profile is called kernel.\nThe pink curve is much smoother than the original! However, the running average cannot describe sharp temperature changes.

How can it be that high, when all the bars around that date are lower? Is the calculation right?\nThe answer is that the result of the moving average is assigned to the right-most date in the running window. This is reasonable for COVID-19 cases: for a given day, I can only calculate a 7-day average based on past values, I don’t know what the future will be.\nThere is a simple way of assigning the result to the center of the window:\n\ndf_covid['7d_avg_center'] = (\n                             df_covid['new_confirmed']\n                                 .rolling(window='7D',\n                                          center=True)  # THIS\n                                 .mean()\n                            )\n\n\n\nplot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,5))\nst = '2022-01-01'\nen = '2022-03-30'\nnew_cases = ax.bar(df_covid[st:en].index, df_covid.loc[st:en,'new_confirmed'],\n       color=\"tab:blue\", width=1)\nmov_avg, = ax.plot(df_covid.loc[st:en,'7d_avg'],\n        color='xkcd:hot pink')\nmov_avg_center, = ax.plot(df_covid.loc[st:en,'7d_avg_center'],\n                          color='xkcd:mustard')\nax.legend(handles=[new_cases, mov_avg, mov_avg_center],\n          labels=['new confirmed cases',\n                  '7-day moving average',\n                  'CENTERED 7-day\\nmoving average'],\n          frameon=False)\n# formating dates on x axis\nlocator = mdates.AutoDateLocator(minticks=7, maxticks=11)\nformatter = mdates.ConciseDateFormatter(locator)\nax.xaxis.set_major_locator(locator)\nax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(formatter)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a rule, we will used a centered moving average (center=True), unless stated otherwise. Also, only use min_periods if you know what you are doing.\n\n\n11.4.2 gaussian\nYou can easily change the kernel shape by using the win_type argument.

If we want a standard deviation of 60 minutes, then std_gaussian = 6.

See below a comparison of all examples in the videos above.\n\nOne important question you need to ask is: what are the time scales associated with the processes I’m interested in? For example, if I’m interested in the daily temperature pattern, getting rid of 1-minute-long fluctuations would probably be ok. On the other hand, if we were to smooth the signal so much that all that can be seen are the temperature changes between summer and winter, then my smoothing got out of hand, and I threw away the very process I wanted to study.\nAll this is to say that you need to know in advance a few things about the system you are studying, otherwise you can’t know what is “noise” that can be smoothed away.",

One good example is the Confidence Interval of the Mean, given by:\nCI(\\alpha) = Z(\\alpha) \\cdot SE.\nZ(\\alpha) is the Z-score corresponding to the chosen confidence level \\alpha. The most commonly used confidence level is 95%, which corresponds to a Z-score of 1.96. What does this mean?

    "text": "Outliers are observations significantly different from all other observations. Consider, for example, this temperature graph:\n\nWhile most measured points are between 20 and 30 °C, there is obviously something very wrong with the one data point above 80 °C.\nHow could such a thing come about? This could be the result of non-natural causes, such as measurement errors, wrong data collection, or wrong data entry. On the other hand, this point could have natural sources, such as a very hot spark flying next to the temperature sensor.\nIdentifying outliers is important, because they might greatly impact measures like mean and standard deviation. When left untouched, outliers might make us reach wrong conclusions about our data. See what happens to the slope of this linear regression with and without the outliers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Zhang (2020)\n\n\nZhang, Ou. 2020. “Outliers-Part 3:outliers in Regression.” ouzhang.me. https://ouzhang.me/blog/outlier-series/outliers-part3/.",

In other words: If a point is more than 3 standard deviations away form the mean, then we call it an outlier.\n\nYou can now use this algorithm to any number of time series, let the computer do the hard work.\nOf course, there is nothing sacred about the number 3. You can choose any Z-score you want to perform an analysis on your own data, depending on your needs.\n\n16.2.1 ATTENTION!\nFor data that is gaussianly distributed, we expect that 99.73% of data to fall within 3 standard deviations from the mean. In other words, 0.27% of points would be considered as outliers according to the Z-score method.\n\n\n\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nAssume you have a time series gaussianly distributed, with 10k measurements. We would expect to find about 27 outliers in this time series.\nSo what is the problem?!\nThe thing is, outliers are not supposed to be only data points far from the other points. That’s not enough. A better way of understanding outliers is to imagine that our expected measurements are sampled from a given distribution, and every now an then we have measurements that are sampled from another distribution.\n\n\n\nSource: Taylor Wilson’s “Dealing with Outliers (Part 1): Ignore Them at Your Peril”\nWe should have this in mind always. We wouldn’t want to single out good data as something weird. Our true task is to identify which points in our time series were sampled from a different distribution.

Sometimes extreme events do happen, such as a one-in-a-hundred-year storm, and they have a disproportionate weight on the system you are studying. The outliers might actually be the most interesting points in your data for all you know!\nIn case the outliers are not of interest to you, if you are using robust methods to analyze your data, you don’t necessarily need to do anything either. For instance, let’s say that you want to smooth your time series. If instead of taking the mean inside a sliding window you choose to calculate the median, then outliers shouldn’t be a problem. Test it and see if it’s true. Go on.\nFor many things you need to do (not only smoothing), you might be able to find robust methods. What do you do if you have to use a non-robust method?

    "text": "28.5 Non-stationary data and ADF test\nThe following is partially based on Chatfield (2016, chap. 3, page 63).\nWhat do we do if it turns out that our data is not stationary? Heck, how can we even tell if our data is stationary or not? The most common stationarity test is the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test. This is not a trivial subject that can be completely understood in a few words, so I’ll give the very basic intuition here.\nA stationary time series has a constant mean \\mu. If at a given instant t our state X_t is way above the mean, we would expect that, with a high probability, the next step brings it closer to the mean. This is to say that the the difference between two consecutive states X_t-X_{t-1} depends on the value of X_t! Nonstationary time series do not show this behavior: the differences between two time steps do not depend on the state value. The idea described here is for the Dickey-Fuller test. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test is basically the same, but for time lags p between states, not only 1.\nThe ADF test has a null hypothesis that the time series is not stationary. By applying the test to a given time series, we get a p-value as one of the results. The smaller the p-value, the more evidence we have to reject the null hypothesis, and therefore conclude that our time series is indeed stationary.\nLet’s see an example:\n\n\nShow the code\n# Generate ARIMA(1,1,2) process with differencing\nN = 500\nnp.random.seed(1)\narima_112_diff = sm.tsa.arma_generate_sample(ar=[1, -0.5], ma=[1, 0.7, 0.3], nsample=N)\narima_112 = np.cumsum(arima_112_diff)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(arima_112)\nax.set(xlabel=\"time\",\n       ylabel=\"signal\",\n       title=\"a non-stationary time series\")\nplt.show()\n\nresult = adfuller(arima_112)\nprint('p-value: ', result[1])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np-value:  0.591478751185507\n\n\nSo what do we do if we have a non-stationary time series? One common solution is to apply successive differencing operations, until the outcome becomes stationary.\nLet’s define the difference operator \\nabla as\n\n\\nabla X_t = X_t - X_{t-1}.\n\nNow recalling that the backward shift operator B is defined as\n\nB X_t = X_{t-1},\n\nwe can rewrite the difference operator as\n\n\\begin{split}\n\\nabla X_t &= X_t - BX_t\\\\\n           &= (1-B)X_t.\n\\end{split}\n\nIf we apply the difference operator d times, then we denote this as\n\nW_t = \\nabla^d X_t = (1-B)^d X_t.\n\nLet’s apply the difference operator once to the time series plotted above, and then apply the ADF test.\n\n\nShow the code\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(arima_112_diff)\nax.set(xlabel=\"time\",\n       ylabel=\"signal\",\n       title=\"the same time series as above, after one differencing\")\nplt.show()\n\nresult = adfuller(arima_112_diff)\nprint('p-value: ', result[1])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np-value:  4.7341140554650393e-14",

We saw that a random walk is the integrated version of a white noise. The random walk can be interpreted as a special case of an AR(1) process for \\phi=1. However, an AR process is usually called as such when it is stationary. Because a white noise can be understood as an ARMA(0,0) process, and because differencing the random walk yields a white noise, we can say that the white noise is an ARIMA(0,1,0) process.\nLet’s see two examples of ARIMA processes.\n\n\nShow the code\n\n\n# Generate ARIMA(2,2,1) process with differencing\narima_221_diff = sm.tsa.arma_generate_sample(ar=[1, -0.18, 0.06], ma=[1, -0.5], nsample=N)\n# arima_221 = np.cumsum(arima_221_diff) \narima_221 = np.cumsum(np.cumsum(arima_221_diff)) # \n\n# Plot the ARIMA(1,1,2) process\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(arima_112)\nax.set_title('ARIMA(1,1,2) process')\nplt.show()\n\n# Plot the ARIMA(2,2,1) process\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(arima_221)\nax.set_title('ARIMA(2,2,1) process')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will not fully delve into forecasting right now, but it would be nice to see a real application of ARIMA.

A good way to overcome this is to use the multiplicative model for seasonal decomposition:\n\nY(t) = T(t) \\times S(t) \\times e(t)\n\nThe components are now multiplied together to yield the observed time series. Let’s test it:\n\n\nShow the code\nresult = seasonal_decompose(df_air['Passengers'], period=12, model=\"multiplicative\")\n\n\n\n\nplot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(4,1, figsize=(8,5), sharex=True)\nax[0].plot(result.observed)\nax[0].text(0.5, 0.9, \"observed\", bbox=dict(facecolor='white', alpha=0.8),\n           transform=ax[0].transAxes, ha='center', va='top')\nax[1].plot(result.trend)\nax[1].text(0.5, 0.9, \"trend\", bbox=dict(facecolor='white', alpha=0.8),\n           transform=ax[1].transAxes, ha='center', va='top')\nax[2].plot(result.seasonal)\nax[2].text(0.5, 0.9, \"seasonal\", bbox=dict(facecolor='white', alpha=0.8),\n           transform=ax[2].transAxes, ha='center', va='top')\nax[3].plot(result.resid)\nax[3].text(0.5, 0.9, \"residual\", bbox=dict(facecolor='white', alpha=0.8),\n           transform=ax[3].transAxes, ha='center', va='top');",

    "text": "33.3 STL\nSTL stands for “Seasonal and Trend decomposition using LOESS”. LOESS, in turn means “locally estimated scatterplot smoothing”, and it is a spiced up version of the Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter we saw earlier in this course. The method is not trivially understood as the naive seasonal decompostion we build together, and the full method is described by Cleveland et al. (1990) here. See in this video how the smoothing method works.\n\n\nThey the most striking difference with the plain seasonal decompose method is that the seasonal component is not constant in time, it can stlightly change and evolve over time.\n\n\nShow the code\ndata = df['co2']\nres = STL(data, period=365).fit()\nres.plot();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA possible downside of STL is the fact that it assumes an additive model. If the seasonal oscillations in your data increase with the value of the series, then most probably a multiplicative model would be best for you. How to use STL then? One can take the logarithm of the series, since for a multiplicative model\n\nY(t) = T(t) \\times S(t) \\times e(t)\n\ntaking the logarithms yields\n\n\\log(Y) = \\log(T) + \\log(S) + \\log(e).\n\nWe can now use STL since our model looks like additive now. After using STL, one can exponentiate the results to reverse the logarithm operation.\n\n\n\n\nCleveland, Robert B, William S Cleveland, Jean E McRae, and Irma Terpenning. 1990. “STL: A Seasonal-Trend Decomposition.” J.

    "section": "39.1 Sound and DTW",
    "text": "39.1 Sound and DTW\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW) excels in aligning two time series that may vary in their rhythm or speed. This characteristic makes it particularly useful in applications such as speech recognition, where the goal is to identify specific words or phrases within audio recordings, despite variations in how different speakers might pronounce them. For instance, consider the task of recognizing the word “backpack” in various sound recordings. You might have a reference recording of someone clearly saying “backpack,” which serves as your baseline. When you attempt to find occurrences of this word in recordings of other people speaking, you’ll likely encounter variations in the rhythm — some may say it faster or slower than your reference, or even separate the words - “Back pack”.\nDTW addresses this challenge by allowing a flexible, non-linear alignment between the time series. This flexibility enables DTW to effectively match sequences that have the same underlying patterns but are expressed over different time scales. Therefore, even if different speakers say “backpack” with varying speeds, DTW can align these variations with the reference, making it possible to accurately recognize the word across different speech rhythms.\n\n39.1.1 “I like to eat Hummus”\nThats the sentence we will work with today. We have two recordings of me saying it. In every recording I say it a bit different. We will use DTW to align the words of the two recordings and even warp the every recording to sound like the other.\nStart by listening to these two files: 1. hummus1.wav 1. hummus2.wav\nSound files are basically time series data. So we can import them as np arrays.\n\n\nfrom scipy.io import wavfile\n\nsamplerate, data1 = wavfile.read('hummus1.wav')\n\n\nsamplerate\n\n48000\n\n\nSample rate is the number of samples per second. 48kHz is a standard sample rate for audio files.\n\ndata1.shape\n\n(340992, 2)\n\n\nNote that there are two channels, as the recording is stereo. We will work with only the first channel (left)\n\nlength = data1.shape[0] / samplerate\ntime = np.linspace(0., length, data1.shape[0])\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(time, data1[:, 0])\nax.set_xlabel(\"Time [s]\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Amplitude\")\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow lets import the second recording\n\nsamplerate, data2 = wavfile.read('hummus2.wav')\n\nAs you can see above these time series are huge, 7 seconds of data translate to 336,000 data points (and thats only one channel). In order to speed up computation time we will resample the data so make the series smaller. Note, this wil drastically reduce the audio quality\n\nresample_factor = 64\nhummus1 = data1[:, 0]\nhummus2 = data2[:, 0]\nhummus1_rs = signal.resample(hummus1, int(len(hummus1)/resample_factor))\nhummus2_rs = signal.resample(hummus2, int(len(hummus2)/resample_factor))\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(2,1, sharex=True)\nax[0].plot(hummus1_rs)\nax[1].plot(hummus2_rs)\n\nax[1].set(xlabel='samples', ylabel='amplitude')\nax[0].set( ylabel='amplitude')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementation of DTW will be by using the dtw-python package. Install dtw-python in anaconda using conda install conda-forge::dtw-python\nDocumentation can be found here\n\nfrom dtw import *\n\n# aligning the two time series\nalignment = dtw(hummus1_rs, hummus2_rs, keep_internals=True)\n\nThe package has built in functions for plotting the results.\n\nalignment.plot('threeway')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Align and plot with the Rabiner-Juang type VI-c unsmoothed recursion\nalignment.plot(type=\"twoway\", offset=-30000, match_indices=150)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the few cells below we warp each recording to match the rhythm of the other recording.\nfirst we get the warped index. If we are warping A to match the rhythm of B, then the warped_index will be an array in the length of B where each position has the matching index of A.\n\nhummus1_warped_index = warp(alignment,index_reference=False)\nhummus2_warped_index = warp(alignment,index_reference=True)\n\n\nhummus1_warped_index\n\narray([   0,    0,    0, ..., 5325, 5326, 5327])\n\n\n\nlen(hummus1_warped_index)\n\n8431\n\n\nBelow is a function for upsampling as we want to go back to the original sample rate so we can hear back the warped recording.\n\ndef upsampling(array, factor):\n    # initialize the upsampled array with NaNs\n    us = np.full(int(len(array) * factor), np.nan)\n    # assign original array values to their new positions\n    us[::factor] = array*factor\n    # find indices of the NaNs and the non-NaNs (original values)\n    nans = np.isnan(us)\n    non_nans = ~nans\n    # interpolate using np.interp\n    # for x-coordinates, use np.arange(len(us)) for full array\n    # for xp-coordinates (where we have actual values), use the non-NaN indices\n    # for fp-coordinates (actual values to interpolate), use the non-NaN values in us\n    us[nans] = np.interp(np.flatnonzero(nans), np.flatnonzero(non_nans), us[non_nans])\n    return us.astype(int)\n\n\nhummus1_warped_index_us = upsampling(hummus1_warped_index, resample_factor)\nhummus2_warped_index_us = upsampling(hummus2_warped_index, resample_factor)\n\n\nhummus1_warped_index_us.shape\n\n(539584,)\n\n\nBelow, we replace the index values of warped_index with their corresponding amplitude values.\n\nhummus1_warped = hummus1[hummus1_warped_index_us]\nhummus2_warped = hummus2[hummus2_warped_index_us]\n\n\ncomplet = [hummus1, hummus2_warped, hummus2, hummus1_warped]\nlabels = ['hummus1', 'hummus2_warped', 'hummus2', 'hummus1_warped']\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(4,1, sharex=True)\n\nfor i, hummus in enumerate(complet):\n    ax[i].plot(hummus)\n    ax[i].set_title(labels[i])\n    ax[i].set_ylabel('amplitude')\n    print()\n\nax[3].set_xlabel('sample')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see above the DTW algorithm did a great job.\nNow lets export it back to an audio file and listen.

Strictly speaking, we see above the square root of the power spectrum, but I’ll still call it power spectrum.\nWe call the lowest peak in the spectrum the fundamental frequency. Note that there are other high frequency peaks that follow the fundamental, at regular intervals. These are called overtones, and they are multiples of the fundamental frequency. The fundamental and the overtones are called together the harmonics.\nProbably, the most common tuning standard in western music is A440, meaning that the note corresponding to the A4 on the piano must have a fundamental frequency equal to 440 Hz. Zoom in and find out if the piano was “properly” tuned.\nThe A3 note has its fundamental frequency at half of that, namely 220 Hz.\nWe can now easily check out if the fundamental frequency for B3 as shown in the graph agrees with this rule:\ncalculate frequency for B4\nfactor = 2**(1/12)\nB4 = 440 * factor**2  # two half steps above A4\nprint(f\"B4 = {B4:.2f} Hz\")\n\n\nB4 = 493.88 Hz",

    "text": "The energy associated with a wave is proportional to the square of the wave’s amplitude. When we computed the fft of the signal, we divided it by N, which is akin to dividing by the whole time duration of the signal. For this reason we are dealing with power, which is energy / time. Finally, it should be noted that the square of a complex number z=a+ib is given by\n\n|z|^2 = z\\cdot z^*,\n\nwhere z^*=a-ib is its complex conjugate:\n\nz\\cdot z^* = (a+ib)(a-ib) = a^2 + b^2.\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: N.H. Crowhurst\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Because there are 12 half-steps between A3 and A4, can you figure out a rule how to find the frequency of any note on the piano?\n\n\n\n\n\nDividing an octave in 12 equal half-steps is called “equal temperament”. Multiplying the A3 frequency 12 times by an unknown factor y should give us the frequency of A4:\n\n\\begin{split}\n220 \\times y^{12} &= 440\\\\\ny^{12} &= 2 \\\\\n\\therefore y &= \\sqrt[12]{2}\n\\end{split}",

This is called “Big O notation”.\nThe expression above is called the two-point forward difference formula. Likewise, we can define the two-point backward difference formula:\n\n\\frac{df(t)}{dt} = \\frac{f(t) - f(t-\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t).\n\\tag{47.2}\nIf we sum together Equation 47.1 and Equation 47.2 we get:\n\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n2\\frac{df(t)}{dt} &= \\frac{f(t+\\Delta t) - \\cancel{f(t)}}{\\Delta t} + \\frac{\\cancel{f(t)} - f(t-\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t} \\\\\n&= \\frac{f(t+\\Delta t) - f(t-\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{47.3}\nDividing both sides by 2 gives the two-point central difference formula:\n\n\\frac{df(t)}{dt} = \\frac{f(t+\\Delta t) - f(t-\\Delta t)}{2\\Delta t} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t^2).\n\\tag{47.4}\nTwo things are worth mentioning about the approximation above:\n\nit is balanced, that is, there is no preference of the future over the past.\nits error is proportional to \\Delta t^2, it is a lot more precise than the unbalanced approximations :)\n\n\n\nTo understand why the error is proportional to \\Delta t^2, one can subtract the Taylor expansion of f(t-\\Delta t) from the Taylor expansion of f(t+\\Delta t). See this, pages 3 and 4.\n\nThe function np.gradient calculates the derivative using the central difference for points in the interior of the array, and uses the forward (backward) difference for the derivative at the beginning (end) of the array.\n\n\nThe “gradient” usually refers to a first derivative with respect to space, and it is denoted as \\nabla f(x)=\\frac{df(x)}{dx}. However, it doesn’t really matter if we call the independent variable x or t, the derivative operator is exactly the same.\nCheck out this nice example.",

Don’t forget to convert the time zone from GMT to Boston.\nSet the new converted timestamp as the index.\nSort the entire dataframe based on the chronological order of the index. Here is an example code: df.sort_index(inplace=True)\nPlot all columns and explore the data. Zoom in. Do you see gaps? Outliers? Jumps? Don’t process them yet. Make a list of 3 things you see.\nBonus: Identify any patterns related to outliers/gaps and explain their occurrence.\nCount how many nan values are in each column.\nNow take a look at the datetime index. As noted earlier, the readings on the device are every 30 minutes, but is that what we see in the data? Do we have a continuous datetime index where every index is 30 min apart? Are there gaps? Are the timestamps consistent? Is there a drift (e.g. sometimes the data comes in at 00:30 and sometimes 00:27 or 00:20, etc..). Explain.\nThink about a quick and dirty fix to this problem. Then read below:\n\nAn easy fix will be to resample the data at 30T and take the mean. That will ensure consistent timestamps and no gaps (in the index).\nWhy quick and “dirty”? What is dirty about it? is there a problem? Explain.\nAnyway, we will continue with this. There are other ways but they are a bit more complex.\n\nRe-count the number of nan values in each column. Explain any changes observed.\nNow that the index is consistent and without gaps, we want to all data (fix jumps, remove outliers and fill gaps).\n\nI’ll start with a hint regarding the dendrometer that requires some background knowledge you may not know. The dendrometer has a metal band wrapping the trunk of the tree and it needs to be reset when the sensor readings are approaching the limit of 60,000 \\mum. So you can see it in the data that someone reset the band some day in September. What needs to be done is to shift up all the data after the jump to be a continuation of the data before the jump. Plot the dendrometer data after the shift.\n\nOutliers: show results of at least 2 methods of outlier identification applied to the data. Compare them and choose the one that did the best work and explain. Outliers should be replaced with nan values.\nFilling gaps (missing values): show results of at least 3 methods of gap filling (at least one of them should be advanced for example SARIMAX or Randomforest). Compare them and choose the one that did the best work and explain. Differently from what we learned during class, this time we don’t have the real data to compare to. Bonus: you might find a way to download data from Boston from a meteorological station, and compare to our data.\nAt this point the data should be clean (no outliers or gaps) in all columns and ready for exploration.\nAdd a column of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) based on the air temperature and relative humidity. The formula can be found here.\nUsing the toolkit learned in the course (for example: smoothing, seasonal decompose, detrending, etc..) show the following:\n\nHow temperature affects dendrometer readings (hint, this happens in a large time scale of months). Showing it graphically is enough! No need to prove it statistically (for example don’t apply correlation).\nHow VPD affects tree dendrometer readings (hint, this happens in a small time scale of days, during the hotter months). Showing it graphically is enough! No need to prove it statistically (for example don’t apply correlation).",
