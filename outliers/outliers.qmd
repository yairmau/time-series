## Outliers and Gaps

### Z-score

$$
z  = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma},
$$

where $x$ is a data point, $\mu$ is the time series mean, and $\sigma$ is the time series standard deviation.

```python
def zscore(df, degree=3):
    data = df.copy()
    data['zscore'] = (data - data.mean())/data.std()
    outliers = data[(data['zscore'] <= -degree) | (data['zscore'] >= degree)]
    return outliers['value'], data
```

Now we can simply use this function:

```python
threshold = 2.5
outliers, transformed = zscore(tx, threshold)
```
