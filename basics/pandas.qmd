We will primarily use the Pandas package to deal with data.
Pandas has become the standard Python tool to manipulate time series, and you should get acquainted with its basic usage. This course will provide you the opportunity to learn by example, but I'm sure we will only scratch the surface, and you'll be left with lots of questions.

I provide below a (non-comprehensive) list of useful tutorials, they are a good reference for the beginner and for the experienced user.

Pandas is based on another famous package: Numpy. We will be using both a lot, and you will start every code with

```{.python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```
